# Loan Prediction 
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict credit approval based on customers' historical data. The goal is to build a model that can classify whether a customer's credit will be approved based on their characteristics.

## Project Structure
- `Predição_de_aprovação_de_crédito.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Steps
1. Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
2. Load Data: Load and visualize the dataset to understand its structure and content.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform statistical and visual data analysis to identify patterns and important features.
4. Data Preprocessing: Clean data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize the data.
5. Model Building: Develop and train various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Based on the results, the Random Forest Classifier is the best model.
